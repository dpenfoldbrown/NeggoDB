Static file format
==================

The static files available for download on the 'Download' page (NoGO/downloads) have the following
format:

Each data file corresponds to a combination of a particular organism, branch of GO, and algorithm 
used to predict the negative examples. Files are tab-delimited, and organized by row, with each row
corresponding to a GO term. 

The first column contains the GO term ID, with each subsequent column being the gene name of a 
predicted negative example. Genes are ordered from most to least likely to be a negative example
(that is, the 2nd column holds the likeliest negative example for the GO term). In order to keep 
all rows the same length, each is filled out with "NONE" entries, once there are no more predicted 
negative examples.


Automatically generated file format
===================================

The files generated by selecting Organism, GO branch, and GO term from the NoGO homepage (and
clicking 'Download') have the following format (not including the initial 'Line N: '). Lines in
square brackets are optional, ie, they will not appear if you only select data for one algorithm:


 Line 1: ** NoGO negative gene examples: Organism, GO Term, GO Branch
 Line 2: ** <Algorithm>:  <1stMostNegGene>  <2ndMostNegGene>  <3rdMostNegGene>...
 Line 3: AlgorithmName   GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName   ...
[Line 4: AlgorithmName   GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName   ...]
[Line 5: AlgorithmName   GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName   ...]


Note that the number of gene names included on the negative example line for each algorithm will 
vary. This is because there are only a certain number of negative gene examples for each GO Term. 
Genes that were not found to be negative examples of the given GO Term function are not included.
