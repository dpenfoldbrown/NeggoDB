The static files available for download on the 'Download' page (NoGO/downloads) have the following

Automatically generated file format
===================================

The files generated by selecting Organism, GO branch, and GO term from the NoGO homepage (and
clicking 'Download') have the following format (not including the initial 'Line N: '). Lines in
square brackets are optional, ie, they will not appear if you only select data for one algorithm:


 Line 1: ** NoGO negative gene examples: Organism, GO Term, GO Branch
 Line 2: ** <Algorithm>:  <1stMostNegGene>  <2ndMostNegGene>  <3rdMostNegGene>...
 Line 3: AlgorithmName   GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName   ...
[Line 4: AlgorithmName   GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName   ...]
[Line 5: AlgorithmName   GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName    GeneName   ...]


Note that the number of gene names included on the negative example line for each algorithm will 
vary. This is because there are only a certain number of negative gene examples for each GO Term. 
Genes that were not found to be negative examples of the given GO Term function are not included.
